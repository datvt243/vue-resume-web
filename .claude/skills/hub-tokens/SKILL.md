# /hub-tokens — measure agent-hub's token cost

Read-only diagnostic. No file changes, no seal gate needed.

## Why this exists
`haven/diagrams/dev-loop.prime-mermaid.md` and `doctrine/domains/
PROJECT.md` are both read in full by every worker session (implementer,
verifier, and every subagent spawned for a `/todo` verify pass re-loads
them from scratch). Left unchecked either grows forever and becomes the
single biggest recurring token cost in the hub — this is what the
`dev-loop-archive.md` / `PROJECT-archive.md` conventions (see each file's
own header note) exist to bound. This command measures whether that's
actually happening, instead of guessing.

There's no exact tokenizer available here — the report uses `bytes / 4` as
a documented, consistent proxy (not a real token count). Good enough to
catch size regressions and compare categories; don't quote it as a real
billed-token number.

## Steps
1. Run this exact script from the repo root (adjust `ROOT` if invoked
   elsewhere — it defaults to the current directory):

```bash
ROOT="."
HUB="$ROOT/agent-hub"

bytes_glob() { find $1 -maxdepth "${2:-99}" -type f \( -name "*.md" -o -name "*.yaml" -o -name "*.yml" \) 2>/dev/null -exec cat {} + 2>/dev/null | wc -c | tr -d ' '; }
bytes_glob_exclude() { find "$1" -type f \( -name "*.md" -o -name "*.yaml" -o -name "*.yml" \) ! -iname "*archive*" 2>/dev/null -exec cat {} + 2>/dev/null | wc -c | tr -d ' '; }
row() { local label="$1" b="$2"; local t=$(( b / 4 )); printf "  %-40s %9d B  ~%8d tok\n" "$label" "$b" "$t"; }
check_threshold() {
  local file="$1" threshold="$2" hint="$3"
  [ -f "$file" ] || return
  local b; b=$(wc -c < "$file" | tr -d ' ')
  local kb=$(( threshold / 1024 ))
  if [ "$b" -gt "$threshold" ]; then
    echo "  ⚠ $(basename "$file") is ${b}B (>${kb}KB threshold) — $hint"
  else
    echo "  ✓ $(basename "$file") is ${b}B, under the ${kb}KB threshold"
  fi
}

```

2. Report the output verbatim — don't paraphrase the numbers into prose,
   the table is already the report.
3. If a flag fires on `dev-loop.prime-mermaid.md`, `PROJECT.md`, or
   `worker-runs.log`, that's a real signal to do an archive pass (see
   `dev-loop-archive.md` / `PROJECT-archive.md` / `worker-runs-archive.log`'s
   own convention notes, or the equivalent header sections in the active
   files) — but this command itself never edits anything. Archiving is a
   separate, explicit action. [amended 2026-09-02] The diagram flag prints
   the exact rows to move (not just "consider moving nodes") — copy-paste
   is the whole remaining effort, so there's no excuse to defer it past the
   current session the way a vague warning invites.
4. [added 2026-09-05] If a flag fires on one of the 5 static reference
   files (`MEMORY.md`, `SOUL.md`, `INDEX.md`, `standards/*.md`), that's
   NOT an archive signal — those files have no accumulating list and no
   defined archive destination by design. Treat it as an anomaly: read the
   file, find what's misplaced (a Correction that belongs in the worker's
   own `MEMORY.md`, a Decision that belongs in `PROJECT.md`, a recipe that
   belongs in `haven/workers/<wid>/recipes/`), and move it to its one
   correct home instead of inventing a new archive file for a file that
   was never meant to grow.

## If this hub uses epic sharding [added 2026-09-02]
If `haven/diagrams/index.md` exists (opt-in, see
`kit/agent-hub-templates.md` §9️⃣.3), `DIAG_ACTIVE_B` above sums bytes
across **every** `dev-loop-<epic>.prime-mermaid.md`, not just the one(s)
marked `active: true`. Treat "haven/diagrams/ (active file only)" as an
**upper bound** in that case, not the real per-session cost — `/boot` and
`pick_next` only read the active epic file(s) + `index.md`, per
`boot.md` step 5. This script doesn't parse `index.md`'s `active` column
(keeping it a plain byte-counting script, not a markdown-table parser) —
if you need the real per-session number under sharding, sum
`index.md` + only the active epic file(s) by hand.

## What the numbers mean
- **Recurring per-session cost** — what a fresh implementer or verifier
  worker reads before touching any code. This is the number that actually
  compounds: every subagent spawned for a verify pass pays it again, from
  zero, with no cache reuse across separate agent contexts.
- **Cold storage** — `evidence/` and archived rows from the diagram,
  `PROJECT.md`, and `worker-runs.log`. Large here is normal and not itself
  a problem: `/boot` and `pick_next` only touch a handful of the most
  recent evidence notes, not the whole directory. Only worth worrying
  about if something starts reading it in bulk (e.g. a recipe that globs
  all of `evidence/` instead of the specific notes it needs).

## Runtime
`/hub-tokens`. Read-only — no seal gate, no evidence note, no worker
identity needed (this isn't a code-repo change).
